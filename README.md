# list-pokemons

Challenge for AgiBank squad, in which we list some information about pokemon stats; like name, abilities, type and power. This app can filter by name of pokemon or power level, while also providing with images from the pokemons. Clicking on the pokemon stats button, check the details of the chosen pokemon.
